# DATA204

In the python fundamental teachable course, I have covered various topics such as Data types: There are 4 data types in Python which are "strings" , Boolean (True, False), Integers(1,3,7), Float(5.7, 8.45). 

Collections such as
1.Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.    mylist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

2. Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable. mytuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")

3. Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable.   myset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}#

4. Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs. dictionary is a collection which is ordered*, changeable and do not allow duplicates.
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}


 
For loops example
a = 33
b = 200
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a") and while loops as well functions. 
  
 While loop example
  i = 1
while i < 6:
  print(i)
  if i == 3:
    break
  i += 1
